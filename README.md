#  Barbell [![barbell](img/barbell_logo.png)]

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ceejbot/barbell.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A nodejs command-line tool for tracking a 5x5 lifting program.

Still in early development mode. 

## Implementation notes

### Interactions

#### Setup

Interview for name & prefs on first run. Settings gear will revisit all choices.

Display in Metric vs American weights. (All weights recorded in pounds; conversion at moment of display.)

Rest time in milliseconds; defaults to 3 * 60 * 1000.

#### Record a workout

TODO: update this design for command-line-ness.

Record a new workout. 

- Show a page with the appropriate workout with suggested starting weights + reminder of reps per set.
- Workout is the next one in the cycle.
- If success in last iteration of the lift, weight is bumped up 5lbs/2.5 kg.

At workout start, the first lift is shown. Name in big type.

*First stage:* warm up. Warmup weight progression is suggested.  

*Second stage:* lift.

A "start" button commences the set. The weight display switches to show the goal weight, with possibly a suggestion for which plates to put on the bar. After that "5 reps" or "3 reps", then the button pair. This display should comfortably take up most of an iPhone screen.

Each set has a checkmark / cancel button pair next to it. The user presses checkmark to indicate success in all lifts, cancel to indicate failure. If failure, user can optionally enter how many reps were successes.

*Third stage:* rest.  When the success/fail button is pressed, the rest timer starts. Countdown + "stop and move on" button shown.

At end of rest stage, next set is shown.

At end of workout, total time elapsed + congratulatory message.

#### Edit workouts

- Add/remove lifts from workouts.  
- Add new lifts to available list.  
- Add/remove workouts.   

#### History

View workout history. Graphs for each lift? Some kind of encouraging visualization of progress over time.

### Data tracked

Two workouts: A, B. Each workout has 3 lifts.

Lift data structure: 

- uid: probably auto-generated by couch
- title: string; short, shown everywhere in UI
- 3reps: boolean; this lift gets sets of 3 reps because of intensity

User data:

```javascript
{
    name: 'Human Name',
    tz: tz-name,
    workouts:
    {
        A: [ uid1, uid2, uid3 ],
        B: [ uid1, uid4, uid5 ]
    },
    lifts:
    {
        uid1: { max: weight-in-lbs, ts: last-time-lifted },
        uid2: { max: weight-in-lbs, ts: last-time-lifted },
        // etc;
    }
}
```

History: Array of workouts.

Workout data structure:

```javascript
{
    label: "A",
    ts: ms-since-epoch,
    lifts:
    [
        { 
            id: 'lift-id',
            weight: weight-in-lbs,
            done: boolean
        },
        { id: 'id2', weight: w, done: bool }
    ]
}
```
